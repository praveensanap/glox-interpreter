- 

This is my attempt to implement the interpreter from the book [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/) in Go.

## Usage

```go run main.go examples/sample.lox```

## Progress
- [x] Part 1: Welcome
- [x] Chapter 1: Introduction
- [x] Chapter 2: A Map of the Territory
- [x] Chapter 3: The Lox Language
- [] Part 2: A Tree-Walk Interpreter
- [x] Chapter 4: Scanning. The scanner package reads source code and produces a stream of tokens.
- [] Chapter 5: Representing Code. The ast package represents the syntax tree of the source code.
- [] Chapter 6: Parsing Expression. The parser package parses the stream of tokens into an abstract syntax tree.
